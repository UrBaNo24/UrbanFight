üìÑ **Project Requirements** üìÑ
-----------------

- [x] üíª **Frontend** üíª
	- [x] Basic Requirements
		- [x] Code separation into different files.
		- [x] Any dynamically created .html objects should be integrated into the DOM.
		- [x] Local storage for controlling access by different users to the web application.
		- [x] Adding some form of interactivity to the website.
		- [x] Allowing asynchronous design of the website and making requests to the server's database.

	- [x] Additional Requirements
		- [x] If the website has functions like deleting, moving, swapping, etc., objects, use 'drag and drop' implementation.
		- [x] Code modularization (import and export).
		- [x] Generate automated and random behavior for using the web application.
		- [x] Additional functionality.

- [x] üîå **Backend** üîå
	- [x] Basic Requirements
		- [x] Model-View-Controller.
		- [x] Use version 8 of the Laravel framework.
		- [x] Preferably use Laravel UI with Bootstrap as the Starter Kit, but Laravel Breeze with Tailwind CSS can also be used.
		- [x] Local storage to control access by different users to the web application (visitors, registered users, and administrators).
		- [x] Proper session control and route protection through middlewares.
		- [x] Grouping routes, templates, template inheritance, dynamic components, etc.
		- [x] Pagination.
		- [x] Additional features.
		- [x] Follow PHP style standards.
		- [x] Code documentation and justification of decisions made.
		- [x] Use MariaDB or MySQL.
		- [x] Database with a minimum of 5 tables.
		- [x] A minimum of one table for users.
		- [x] Include an E/R schema in the project (README).
		- [x] The database must be created using framework tools (migrations, seeders, and factories) and not directly via PHPMyAdmin or the console.

	- [ ] Additional Requirements
		- [x] Use of Breeze (with Tailwind CSS) or Jetstream (with Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap), in addition to other aspects of the framework that complement the content taught and expand the functionality of the application.
		- [x] Proper language usage.
		- [ ] Use dynamic components based on Vue.js and Axios.js for asynchronous background communication.

- [x] üöÄ **Deployment** üöÄ

    - [x] Basic Requirements
		- [x] The web application must be accessible from the internet, i.e., it cannot be deployed on local machines.

	- [x] Additional Requirements	
	    - [x] It is positively valued if the DBMS used by the web application is hosted on a different machine than the one where the web application is deployed.
		- [x] Load balancer.

- [x] üåà **Design** üåà
	- [x] Create a prototype in Figma.
		- [x] Select a dominant color.
		- [x] Create a color palette with the selected dominant color. The palette can be monochromatic, analogous, or complementary.
		- [x] Select a font for the prototype and explain the font choice.
		- [x] Create a harmonious combination with another font, applying different weights in visual hierarchy.
		- [x] Select two colors for text and background, calculating the contrast between them according to the WCAG 2 standard.
		- [x] Apply several examples in your "Visual Balance and Compositional Tension" composition. Explain the choice of these elements and the meaning they contribute.
		- [x] The prototype will be designed for a resolution of 1920 x 1080, using a 12-column grid and for mobile resolution 360 x 640.

	- [x] CSS3
		- [x] Use CSS3 to style the interface; no Frameworks like Bootstrap, Materialize, UIKit, etc., are allowed.
		- [x] The interface design should be "Responsive" using Media Queries, FlexBox, and Grid layout.
		- [x] Use the SASS preprocessor to structure CSS files into a single main.css (main.scss) with @import for other scss files (colors, header, footer, body...).
		- [x] Use the BEM methodology for selector description, variables, etc.
 	
 	- [x] HTML
 		- [x] Insert one multimedia element of each type: video, sound, canvas, and SVG.
 		- [x] Libraries like Chartjs, D3.js, koolChart, Snap.svg, or any other can be used to include charts, animations, image galleries for canvas or SVG.
 
	- [x] Use vector graphics software like Inkscape to create a vector logo that can be animated with Snap.svg or anime.js to fulfill the previous point.
